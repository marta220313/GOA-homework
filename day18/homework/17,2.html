    <h3>Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir (French: Miraculous, les aventures de Ladybug et Chat Noir; commonly abbreviated as 
        Miraculous Ladybug or simply Miraculous)[9][10][11][12][2] is a French animated magical girl superhero[13] television series 
        created by Thomas Astruc and developed by Jeremy Zag. The series is produced by the French company Miraculous Corp. 
        (a joint venture of Mediawan and ZAG, Inc.),[14] and co-produced with Japanese studio Toei Animation's European division, 
        and several international companies.[a]

        The series focuses on two Parisian teenagers, Marinette Dupain-Cheng and Adrien Agreste, who transform into the superheroes Ladybug and 
        Cat Noir, respectively, to protect the city from supervillains.
        
        Prior to its debut in France on 19 October 2015 on TF1's TFOU block,[15] the series was first shown in South Korea on 1 September 2015 
        on EBS1.[16] Internationally, it is mainly broadcast on Disney-owned channels or on Disney+, with exceptions in some countries.
        
        The series spawned a media franchise with several products tied to it, including various comic books, novels, and video games. 
        A film adaptation, Ladybug & Cat Noir: The Movie, was released theatrically in 2023, premiering in France.</h3>
